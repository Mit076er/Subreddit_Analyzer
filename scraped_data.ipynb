Also, can anyone really differentiate between Salmon and Tickle Me Pink?  I studied the Crayola slides from lecture and even made flashcards, but I still can’t taste a difference.  This is dumb, I’m going to have to take the class over again next semester.', '', '', 'I\\'m hoping that people do not read the title of this post and downvote it immediately, because I am trying to have a real discussion here. Fraternities may not be the *only* group responsible from spreading the COVID-19 virus, but they are definitely a big part of it. Here are a few reasons.\\n\\nFirst, in-person rush events. I guarantee that every mid to top tier fraternity on campus has had at least some of these, since otherwise they would not get a big enough pledge class. It\\'s been a \"well, since they\\'re doing it, I guess we should do it\" kind of thing. This is bad because it is basically turning these poor freshmen into super-spreaders. They rush around 3 or 4 different frats, and if they have COVID, they will just spread it everywhere. Plus, they will bring it back to their dorm, and likely spread it to people there as well.\\n\\nSecond, lack of compliance with the University. Every single brother that I\\'ve talked to has failed to keep up with the bi-weekly testing policy. Excuses that I\\'ve heard are \"but I\\'m only hanging out with people from the house\" or \"the University testing center is 100% booked for this week.\" If you want to get tested, it is not difficult. I got one at the Urgent Care across from the Varsity, and it only took me like 20 minutes. The bottom line is that the University is not punishing anyone for breaking the rules that they set. I want them to, and I do not care if they specifically go out of their way to specifically punish members of Greek Life. It would be one of the absolute best things that they can do to limit the spread of Coronavirus.\\n\\nThird, full on socials. While my fraternity has not had any real socials this semester, I know that a solid 25% of them have. And I\\'m not talking small get togethers, I\\'m talking >100 people in a sweaty basement without masks. Plus, since a good10-20% of each chapter is made up of off-campus students, there is no shot that they\\'ve been getting regularly tested. On top of this, some groups have literally been caught by police. This is supposed to come with a $5000 fine as well as probation from IFC. That sure as hell has not been happening, but it definitely needs to.\\n\\nNow, I want to pre-emptively answer some of the things that people may be thinking.\\n\\n1. \"Why did you post this?\"\\n\\nI really don\\'t know if there are any other fraternity members in this subreddit, since it seems like Reddit is generally pretty anti-frat. But if there are, I want you guys to start taking some responsibility for what is going on here. Anybody that tells you that \"we are just the University\\'s scapegoats\" is lying to their self. If you are not a part of a Greek organization, but you know people that are, feel free to show them this post or talk to them. It may be difficult, and they may get extremely defensive, but I\\'ve found that the most difficult conversations are often the most important.\\n\\n2) \"Why are you even in a fraternity? Greek Life deserves to be completely abolished\"\\n\\nFirst, I think that Greek Life has a lot of benefits. As an introvert, it has really brought me out of my shell (testudo pun not intended) and improved the social aspect of my life. It has also been a great networking tool for me, and was the reason I landed an Internship for the upcoming summer. However, I acknowledge that there are major problems. Racism, sexism, homophobia, ableism, and hazing within fraternities are not myths. While there have been MAJOR improvements in recent years, it will still take a tremendous amount of work to completely remove these things from fraternity culture. I genuinely believe that we are moving in the right direction, and one of the reasons that I joined was to be a positive influence in that movement. However, if I\\'m wrong and these things will never change, then yeah, abolish Greek Life.\\n\\n3) \"What the hell bro, it\\'s like totally not frat of you to post this. You\\'re, like, putting our brotherhood at risk dude\"\\n\\nGood', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'For anyone who is in the engineering school, you received a notice about the loss of a student at the University of Maryland by the name of Trevor Quinn.

I can start bearing partial weight on my injured leg starting in late May, so for now I\\'ve been using crutches, a wheelchair, and rolling office chairs to get around. A nurse and a physical therapist visit my home a couple times a week. And my pain was really intense at first, but as of recently, it is almost completely gone! I\\'m just taking Tylenol at nighttime. And every time I go into the doctor\\'s office, they talk about how \"beautifully\" my wound is healing. \\n\\nI also just want to mention that there are some pretty amazing people out there. Like a head UMD official in Student Affairs who reached out to me to offer help in case I needed it. As it happened, I did need help with some things like dropping classes for the semester, which was really helpful. I even got to know them a little bit, and let me just say, this person is so very kind. \\n\\nOther people have also been incredibly supportive. Like all the comments on my original post which were so encouraging. And when I was running out of wound care supplies (due to an error by the nursing care company), we made an Amazon wishlist of wound care stuff so that people could help buy some if they wanted to. (Wound care gets really expensive fast). *The Amazon wishlist was completely bought in less than a couple days*. Not to mention all the cards, visits in the hospital (back when COVID wasn\\'t a big concern), and even money from people I don\\'t know that gave without even being asked. This experience has honestly restored my faith in humanity. \\n\\nHealing is never easy, but it\\'s been made so much better thanks to all the lovely people in the world. And once it became my new normal, this whole thing got a lot easier. I\\'m just happy that I can be more mobile now, and do things like lift weights or make myself cookies. \\n\\nStay safe everyone.

Sadly, I couldn\\'t save someone from living there. Fuck the Varsity.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**If you can read the whole story, it\\'s for sure the craziest thing that has ever happened to me. TLDR at the end.**\\n\\n**DO NOT SUBLEASE OR TAKE APARTMENT 646 IN THE VARSITY, NASTY SHIT HAPPENED THERE! DO NOT LIVE THERE! I lived there this past year and just learned that the management is subleasing one of the rooms in 646. I have a horrible roommate story and you for sure won\\'t want to live in room 646C after reading this.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI lived in a 3x3 in the Varsity this past year and had 2 random roommates. One of the roommates was a normal guy and the other roommate was for sure the worst roommate you could ever had. From here on I\\'ll refer to him as roommate X and my other roommate as roommate normal. When I moved in in August I didn\\'t see roommate X until we had already been living there for 3 weeks. He came out of his room, was very odd, and couldn\\'t hold a normal conversation. The only thing I was able to get out of the conversation was that he didn\\'t go to UMD and went to Montgomery College in Silver Spring. Also, he looked like he was in his late 20s, though I never learned his age. I didn\\'t pay much attention to him, or the conversation, and went on with my life. Half of the fall semester passed and I almost never saw him, he was in his room \\\\~23 hours a day. He was always wearing the exact same clothes, a Montgomery College hoodies and black jeans.\\n\\nTowards the end of the semester, he started sitting in the common area for \\\\~12 hours a day just staring at an analog clock on his laptop. He would do nothing all day but stare at the clock on his laptop, I later learned he did that because he didn\\'t know how to connect to Varsity WiFi. Every time someone came over to my apartment he would ask them \"How is the weather?\" or \"Can you be my mentor?\". He couldn\\'t really hold a conversation with anyone, and while he looked normal, talking to him you came to the realization he wasn\\'t.\\n\\nOne day in the fall semester, roommate normal was drinking and roommate X came outside while he was using the bathroom. He took the handle of alcohol that roommate normal was drinking, hid it under the sink, and yelled to roommate normal \"I am going to finish your bottle\". The bottle was about 3/4 full. Roommate normal got annoyed by this and asked roommate X to give his bottle back, which he didn\\'t respond to for a couple minutes. Things got tense and roommate normal yelled at roommate X, \"I don\\'t even care about the bottle just tell me what you did with it, I know you didn\\'t just chug 3/4 of a handle\". Roommate X yelled back for \\\\~20 minutes his response, \"ZILCH ZILCH, I\\'M STAMEN!\". I still don\\'t really know what he meant by that. We finally found the bottle under the kitchen sink and told roommate X to stop sitting in the common area because we had gotten annoyed of him. After all of this happened, he also ate most of our groceries one week and never acknowledge it even though we saw him eating them.\\n\\nDuring finals week of the fall semester his room started to smell like shit, to be honest. Also, I saw a brand new pair of Jordan 11 Concords that he had thrown in the trash. I stopped using the kitchen and the common area. I was anxious to get out of the apartment and go home for winter break. I finished my finals and moved back home for a month.\\n\\nI came back for the spring semester in the end of January and the smell was gone. Now he had a new quirk though, he would knock on my room door and other apartment\\'s doors at around 2:00 AM, and ask random questions like \"How\\'s the weather?\", \"Are there any holidays coming up?\" and \"Can you be my mentor?\". This went on for a while and I just stopped answering the door whenever he knocked on it.\\n\\nOne day I came back to the apartment at \\\\~12:00 AM and was 7/8 police officers in front of my door. A girl was standing their crying about roommate X knocking on her door night after night. The police officers asked his name, where his apartment was and why he kept bothering her. To every question he responded, \"Are there any holidays coming up? How about St. Paddy\\'s day\". I helped the cops get him back into the apartment. Twenty minutes later, I was leaving the apartment myself and he kept following me out. I yelled at him to stay in the apartment multiple times, and finally I realized he wouldn\\'t follow me out of the main lobby because of the security guards there. I started walking towards the front elevator when he got very frustrated and yelled out \"You\\'re being mean to me!\" He looked the other way in the hallway for 20 seconds, turned back to me and said \"You\\'re being mean to my friend too!\", and slammed the door. I learned from roommate normal that he got into a fist fight with him later that night.\\n\\nBy now I was annoyed and talked to the Varsity about him and the situation so far. They gave literally no help and said this is a roommate issue, we cannot do anything about it. This is when the situation with roommate X got even worse. His room started smelling worse by the day, and for some reason he would keep his door a bit open. A friend of mine and I confronted him about the smell, to which he said \"I think that is the fresh air\". Both roommate normal and I, got annoyed by this and started closing his door ourselves whenever we saw it open. But the smell kept getting worse and worse. It smelled like a dead animal was in his room. We didn\\'t know what to do, so we started keeping our windows open 24/7 to try to keep the smell at bay. The smell still was getting worse by the day, so a couple weeks before finals we stopped using the air conditioning. The AC would vent his terrible smelling air into our rooms, making them unlivable.\\n\\nI went to the Varsity office and flipped a shit about this whole situation, to which they said, \"This is a roommate issue we can\\'t do anything about it\". This was even after I made one of the employees come up to smell my apartment. She said it smells like a dead animal and empathized with us about the issue, but qualified her statement by saying \"we can\\'t do anything about it because it is his room\". She said the manager would contact us by the end of the week. That week passed and the Varsity did nothing, so I talked to them again and they gave me the cold shoulder. By know I was very fed up and realized things had to be escalated.\\n\\nBy now roommate X looked like he didn\\'t shower in months and was still wearing the same Montgomery college hoodie and black jeans. I knew something had to be very wrong and called the police. Two officers came the same day I called and immediately smelled the apartment and said, \"Something is very wrong here, that smells like a dead body.\" They got roommate X to open the door and come out. The smell that came head on from his room was literally the worst possible smell you could imagine. They talked with him for \\\\~20 minutes trying to learn his name and other info, to which he would still respond \"How is the weather today?\". They told me to go to the Varsity office and get someone to come up to the apartment to help them deal with it. I went downstairs, and tried to get the Varsity to help me out. Once again they gave me the cold shoulder and said they were very busy, even though the office was empty and to get the officers to come downstairs. I relayed this message to the police officers who said, \"You have to make them come, we have a situation here and can\\'t loose the little rapport we have gotten with him \\\\[roommate x\\\\] so far.\" I went back down to the office and made a scene, which after 15 minutes, made the manager finally come up to the apartment.\\n\\nAs soon as he came up and smelled the apartment, he turned to me and said \"We are going to get a crew up here to clean the whole common area and his \\\\[roommate X\\'s\\\\] room.\" A couple more police officers came up to the apartment and struggled to get him to leave his doorway so the cleaning crew could come to clean his room. Given that I had an exam the next day, I went back into my room to study. I came out two hours later and talked to the police officer who said they were going to take him to the hospital for a psychiatric evaluation. The cleaning crew was still cleaning his room. I talked to one of the maintenance people cleaning his room who said \"Y\\'all are men for dealing with this\", about me and roommate normal. I asked him what the smell was and he told me that his bathroom was packed with plastic water bottles full of urine and there were multiple trash bags in the tub that were filled with literal shit.\\n\\nThe police officers told me they didn\\'t have a reason to keep roommate X in the hospital as he looked normal and was able to perform basic tasks like eating and some level of communication, so he may return. Some hospital representative came to discuss pretty much everything that happened that I wrote about above, before they took him to the hospital. The maintenance crew left a ton of air freshener and cloroxed his whole room. His mom came \\\\~2 days later to move all of his stuff out of the apartment and apologized to me and roommate normal. She claimed she didn\\'t know he was this bad and said she thought he was still going to school, even though I never saw him leave the building in the whole year he lived in the apartment.\\n\\nI just learned that the Varsity is trying to sublease his room and am posting this to save some poor soul from having to live in that room. Who knows what else went on in that room.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR: Room 646C in the Varsity had literally bags of shit and pee all over the room and it smelled terrible. The person who lived there didn\\'t shower for a whole year.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT: The worst part is that none of this is fake or exaggerated, and I wish it was. If anything I left stuff out to make it shorter.\\n\\nEDIT 2: Mods asked me to remove the picture of roommate X.', \"Hello from a professor - good luck tomorrow and I hope you have a great semester.

The emergency team workers were also phenomenal, and I am so fortunate for them. And I also want to thank whoever called 911 so quickly as well as the student that made a makeshift tourniquet. I could have died from the blood loss, and there was (and still is) a very real risk I may never be able to use my left leg again. But thanks to how quickly everyone acted (and some luck!) I still have a pulse in that leg and am able to wiggle my left toes, so I have good prospects for being able to run again someday, maybe even as soon as a year from now. :)\\n\\nSo, thank you all so so much!

              "  'body': 'I\\'m hoping that people do not read the title of this post and downvote it immediately, because I am trying to have a real discussion here. Fraternities may not be the *only* group responsible from spreading the COVID-19 virus, but they are definitely a big part of it. Here are a few reasons.\\n\\nFirst, in-person rush events. I guarantee that every mid to top tier fraternity on campus has had at least some of these, since otherwise they would not get a big enough pledge class. It\\'s been a \"well, since they\\'re doing it, I guess we should do it\" kind of thing. This is bad because it is basically turning these poor freshmen into super-spreaders. They rush around 3 or 4 different frats, and if they have COVID, they will just spread it everywhere. Plus, they will bring it back to their dorm, and likely spread it to people there as well.\\n\\nSecond, lack of compliance with the University. Every single brother that I\\'ve talked to has failed to keep up with the bi-weekly testing policy. Excuses that I\\'ve heard are \"but I\\'m only hanging out with people from the house\" or \"the University testing center is 100% booked for this week.\" If you want to get tested, it is not difficult. I got one at the Urgent Care across from the Varsity, and it only took me like 20 minutes. The bottom line is that the University is not punishing anyone for breaking the rules that they set. I want them to, and I do not care if they specifically go out of their way to specifically punish members of Greek Life. It would be one of the absolute best things that they can do to limit the spread of Coronavirus.\\n\\nThird, full on socials. While my fraternity has not had any real socials this semester, I know that a solid 25% of them have. And I\\'m not talking small get togethers, I\\'m talking >100 people in a sweaty basement without masks. Plus, since a good10-20% of each chapter is made up of off-campus students, there is no shot that they\\'ve been getting regularly tested. On top of this, some groups have literally been caught by police. This is supposed to come with a $5000 fine as well as probation from IFC. That sure as hell has not been happening, but it definitely needs to.\\n\\nNow, I want to pre-emptively answer some of the things that people may be thinking.\\n\\n1. \"Why did you post this?\"\\n\\nI really don\\'t know if there are any other fraternity members in this subreddit, since it seems like Reddit is generally pretty anti-frat. But if there are, I want you guys to start taking some responsibility for what is going on here. Anybody that tells you that \"we are just the University\\'s scapegoats\" is lying to their self. If you are not a part of a Greek organization, but you know people that are, feel free to show them this post or talk to them. It may be difficult, and they may get extremely defensive, but I\\'ve found that the most difficult conversations are often the most important.\\n\\n2) \"Why are you even in a fraternity? Greek Life deserves to be completely abolished\"\\n\\nFirst, I think that Greek Life has a lot of benefits. As an introvert, it has really brought me out of my shell (testudo pun not intended) and improved the social aspect of my life. It has also been a great networking tool for me, and was the reason I landed an Internship for the upcoming summer. However, I acknowledge that there are major problems. Racism, sexism, homophobia, ableism, and hazing within fraternities are not myths. While there have been MAJOR improvements in recent years, it will still take a tremendous amount of work to completely remove these things from fraternity culture. I genuinely believe that we are moving in the right direction, and one of the reasons that I joined was to be a positive influence in that movement. However, if I\\'m wrong and these things will never change, then yeah, abolish Greek Life.\\n\\n3) \"What the hell bro, it\\'s like totally not frat of you to post this. You\\'re, like, putting our brotherhood at risk dude\"\\n\\nGood',\n",

Trevor was a good friend of mine since high school and we are all saddened by his loss. Trevor was an aerospace student and excelled at everything he did. As long as I’ve known him he’s been a good hearted guy, and he’s always been someone I can personally count on. Use this time to tell the people that you care about most that you love them, and let’s not forget to carry on Trevor’s legacy.\\n\\nEDIT: Thank you guys for the overwhelming support, I know he is looking down on us smiling. Big thanks to everyone who’s left kind remarks on his obituary. You all made my night, and I’m sure the night of his family as well. Much love terp family.',\n",

              "  'body': 'Hey UMD! I know times are tough right now and we can probably all use some good news right now so I thought I\\'d give an update on how my healing is going. \\n\\nI\\'ve been out of the hospital since March 16 and I\\'m staying with my parents right now. I can start bearing partial weight on my injured leg starting in late May, so for now I\\'ve been using crutches, a wheelchair, and rolling office chairs to get around. A nurse and a physical therapist visit my home a couple times a week. And my pain was really intense at first, but as of recently, it is almost completely gone! I\\'m just taking Tylenol at nighttime. And every time I go into the doctor\\'s office, they talk about how \"beautifully\" my wound is healing. \\n\\nI also just want to mention that there are some pretty amazing people out there. Like a head UMD official in Student Affairs who reached out to me to offer help in case I needed it. As it happened, I did need help with some things like dropping classes for the semester, which was really helpful. I even got to know them a little bit, and let me just say, this person is so very kind. \\n\\nOther people have also been incredibly supportive. Like all the comments on my original post which were so encouraging. And when I was running out of wound care supplies (due to an error by the nursing care company), we made an Amazon wishlist of wound care stuff so that people could help buy some if they wanted to. (Wound care gets really expensive fast). *The Amazon wishlist was completely bought in less than a couple days*. Not to mention all the cards, visits in the hospital (back when COVID wasn\\'t a big concern), and even money from people I don\\'t know that gave without even being asked. This experience has honestly restored my faith in humanity. \\n\\nHealing is never easy, but it\\'s been made so much better thanks to all the lovely people in the world. And once it became my new normal, this whole thing got a lot easier. I\\'m just happy that I can be more mobile now, and do things like lift weights or make myself cookies. \\n\\nStay safe everyone. Especially around UMD buses. 😉\\n\\nEdit: I did get a full refund for the classes I dropped this semester, thanks to the help of the UMD official! Sadly, no free tuition going forward :P',\n",

              "  'body': 'The folks at Marathon just came in clutch for me. Its mundane, a typical UMD story, but its just a lil reminder of the enduring blessing to this campus that Marathon is.\\n\\nIts 2:30am; my food total for the day is two bowls of cereal, thanks Zoom, life, and the facts that the diner seems to close before the sun sets nowadays. And pretty much everything is closed by this hour, so its looking like tough luck for tonight. But I\\'m tryna stay up all night to write this paper, and I\\'m a lil hungy. Apparently Lotsa is dead, RIP, so Marathon\\'s my last bastion. Its a week night, so there\\'s a good chance they closed up early, but its worth a shot.\\n\\nSo I get there like 2:45, lights are out, chairs on tables, damn. But its fuckin wimdy out, and chilly too, and I didn\\'t walk outside all this way in flip-flops and a t-shirt to not at least try the door. Unlocked, anyone home? Spot a dude in the back, but homie gives me that look and hand motion of \"bro nah, I just cleaned all this shit, we closed now don\\'t do me like that\" so I pop a thumbs up and turn to head out. Just as the door is about to close behind me though, I hear my man calling out for me to wait. I walk back to the counter and watch him grab a loaded-ass box of fries off the shelf behind him, grab out two containers of that glorious sauce, and hand me the box without a word. What a hero. Boutta go in on this box. To all who aren\\'t awake, rest well CP',\n",

              "  'body': 'You did it! You finished high school and are a real college student now. We\\'ve made a carefully constructed orientation video for you that will trick you into thinking that you\\'ll spend your days here attending athletic events, socializing with your classmates, and eagerly attending your classes as you work towards a better future. In reality, it\\'ll be about October before you\\'re spending your evenings hiding in your dorm room drinking bottom-shelf Bacardi that your RA sold you, sobbing as you watch the Canvas grade notifications roll in on your phone, just like every other college student in America.\\n\\nNow for the run-down:\\n\\n* It wasn\\'t always this hot; we used to have trees for shade, but then we cut them all down to make room for a metro train, which will soon be threatening your life on a daily basis as it speeds down the most trafficked pedestrian road in the entire county.\\n\\n* Our Math department is still working on a statistical model to predict how many students we will kill via negligence in the 2019-2020 academic year. Rest assured, however, that if deadly mold invades your dorm room, we will notify you no more than 2 weeks after the health department condemns your building.\\n\\n* Apologies for the construction! Usually we have more, to present our incoming students with a vision of progress and evolution. If it were up to us, there wouldn\\'t be a single parking spot on the entire campus!\\n\\n* Speaking of parking - if you have a car, we\\'ve been asked by DOTs to tell you to go ahead and kill yourself. We\\'re not sure what that means but are almost certain that it\\'s some fleek Twitter lingo.\\n\\n* We hope you enjoy the football games now that you\\'re on a Big 10 campus! Please rest assured, the $21 million fee we incurred for leaving the ACC had absolutely nothing to do with the mid-year tuition hike in 2013, and this cost has in no way been passed along to the students.\\n\\n* We are proud of the 50% of our classrooms which are equipped with cutting edge technology, including smartboards, multiple projector and television screens, assistance for the hearing impaired, and even cameras to record lectures so that students can attend remotely. The other 50% of our classrooms are unfortunately mud huts with no air conditioning.\\n\\n* If you\\'ve been admitted to a STEM department, congratulations! You\\'ll be receiving instruction from some of the highest paid tenured faculty at any east coast public university, all of whom have their own textbooks to sell you. If you\\'ve been admitted to any other department, we hope you enjoy the never ending revolving door of underpaid adjunct faculty!\\n\\n* It is not true that our accreditation is under review. This is Retriever propaganda, spread by the scoundrels at UMBC, and we strongly encourage you not to research the issue further.\\n\\n* Our President\\'s swift descent from S-tier meme champion to cartoon villain is regrettable, and to remedy the issue our search committee for a new president is requiring that we only hire someone with the first name \"Daddy.\" Look forward to this change in the 2020-2021 school year!\\n\\n* Any reports of an unaddressed racist sub-culture at UMD are entirely unfounded. On an unrelated note, please report to Cole Fieldhouse on Monday morning to join Terps for Trump.\\n\\nBest wishes, and welcome to UMD!',\n",

If you did really well it's something good to brag about but if you didn't that's ok too.\\n\\nBad grades don't mean you're dumb\\nBad grades don't mean you're never going to get a job\\nBad grades don't mean you're a terrible person\\nBad grades don't mean you're worthless\\n\\nIt's ok to cut ourselves some slack. If anyone wants to talk/vent my dms are open.\\n\\nBe safe out there terps.\",\n",

              "  'body': '**UPDATE: I got an email that the Varsity sublet roommate X\\'s room. Sadly, I couldn\\'t save someone from living there. Fuck the Varsity.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**If you can read the whole story, it\\'s for sure the craziest thing that has ever happened to me. TLDR at the end.**\\n\\n**DO NOT SUBLEASE OR TAKE APARTMENT 646 IN THE VARSITY, NASTY SHIT HAPPENED THERE! DO NOT LIVE THERE! I lived there this past year and just learned that the management is subleasing one of the rooms in 646. I have a horrible roommate story and you for sure won\\'t want to live in room 646C after reading this.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI lived in a 3x3 in the Varsity this past year and had 2 random roommates. One of the roommates was a normal guy and the other roommate was for sure the worst roommate you could ever had. From here on I\\'ll refer to him as roommate X and my other roommate as roommate normal. When I moved in in August I didn\\'t see roommate X until we had already been living there for 3 weeks. He came out of his room, was very odd, and couldn\\'t hold a normal conversation. The only thing I was able to get out of the conversation was that he didn\\'t go to UMD and went to Montgomery College in Silver Spring. Also, he looked like he was in his late 20s, though I never learned his age. I didn\\'t pay much attention to him, or the conversation, and went on with my life. Half of the fall semester passed and I almost never saw him, he was in his room \\\\~23 hours a day. He was always wearing the exact same clothes, a Montgomery College hoodies and black jeans.\\n\\nTowards the end of the semester, he started sitting in the common area for \\\\~12 hours a day just staring at an analog clock on his laptop. He would do nothing all day but stare at the clock on his laptop, I later learned he did that because he didn\\'t know how to connect to Varsity WiFi. Every time someone came over to my apartment he would ask them \"How is the weather?\" or \"Can you be my mentor?\". He couldn\\'t really hold a conversation with anyone, and while he looked normal, talking to him you came to the realization he wasn\\'t.\\n\\nOne day in the fall semester, roommate normal was drinking and roommate X came outside while he was using the bathroom. He took the handle of alcohol that roommate normal was drinking, hid it under the sink, and yelled to roommate normal \"I am going to finish your bottle\". The bottle was about 3/4 full. Roommate normal got annoyed by this and asked roommate X to give his bottle back, which he didn\\'t respond to for a couple minutes. Things got tense and roommate normal yelled at roommate X, \"I don\\'t even care about the bottle just tell me what you did with it, I know you didn\\'t just chug 3/4 of a handle\". Roommate X yelled back for \\\\~20 minutes his response, \"ZILCH ZILCH, I\\'M STAMEN!\". I still don\\'t really know what he meant by that. We finally found the bottle under the kitchen sink and told roommate X to stop sitting in the common area because we had gotten annoyed of him. After all of this happened, he also ate most of our groceries one week and never acknowledge it even though we saw him eating them.\\n\\nDuring finals week of the fall semester his room started to smell like shit, to be honest. Also, I saw a brand new pair of Jordan 11 Concords that he had thrown in the trash. I stopped using the kitchen and the common area. I was anxious to get out of the apartment and go home for winter break. I finished my finals and moved back home for a month.\\n\\nI came back for the spring semester in the end of January and the smell was gone. Now he had a new quirk though, he would knock on my room door and other apartment\\'s doors at around 2:00 AM, and ask random questions like \"How\\'s the weather?\", \"Are there any holidays coming up?\" and \"Can you be my mentor?\". This went on for a while and I just stopped answering the door whenever he knocked on it.\\n\\nOne day I came back to the apartment at \\\\~12:00 AM and was 7/8 police officers in front of my door. A girl was standing their crying about roommate X knocking on her door night after night. The police officers asked his name, where his apartment was and why he kept bothering her. To every question he responded, \"Are there any holidays coming up? How about St. Paddy\\'s day\". I helped the cops get him back into the apartment. Twenty minutes later, I was leaving the apartment myself and he kept following me out. I yelled at him to stay in the apartment multiple times, and finally I realized he wouldn\\'t follow me out of the main lobby because of the security guards there. I started walking towards the front elevator when he got very frustrated and yelled out \"You\\'re being mean to me!\" He looked the other way in the hallway for 20 seconds, turned back to me and said \"You\\'re being mean to my friend too!\", and slammed the door. I learned from roommate normal that he got into a fist fight with him later that night.\\n\\nBy now I was annoyed and talked to the Varsity about him and the situation so far. They gave literally no help and said this is a roommate issue, we cannot do anything about it. This is when the situation with roommate X got even worse. His room started smelling worse by the day, and for some reason he would keep his door a bit open. A friend of mine and I confronted him about the smell, to which he said \"I think that is the fresh air\". Both roommate normal and I, got annoyed by this and started closing his door ourselves whenever we saw it open. But the smell kept getting worse and worse. It smelled like a dead animal was in his room. We didn\\'t know what to do, so we started keeping our windows open 24/7 to try to keep the smell at bay. The smell still was getting worse by the day, so a couple weeks before finals we stopped using the air conditioning. The AC would vent his terrible smelling air into our rooms, making them unlivable.\\n\\nI went to the Varsity office and flipped a shit about this whole situation, to which they said, \"This is a roommate issue we can\\'t do anything about it\". This was even after I made one of the employees come up to smell my apartment. She said it smells like a dead animal and empathized with us about the issue, but qualified her statement by saying \"we can\\'t do anything about it because it is his room\". She said the manager would contact us by the end of the week. That week passed and the Varsity did nothing, so I talked to them again and they gave me the cold shoulder. By know I was very fed up and realized things had to be escalated.\\n\\nBy now roommate X looked like he didn\\'t shower in months and was still wearing the same Montgomery college hoodie and black jeans. I knew something had to be very wrong and called the police. Two officers came the same day I called and immediately smelled the apartment and said, \"Something is very wrong here, that smells like a dead body.\" They got roommate X to open the door and come out. The smell that came head on from his room was literally the worst possible smell you could imagine. They talked with him for \\\\~20 minutes trying to learn his name and other info, to which he would still respond \"How is the weather today?\". They told me to go to the Varsity office and get someone to come up to the apartment to help them deal with it. I went downstairs, and tried to get the Varsity to help me out. Once again they gave me the cold shoulder and said they were very busy, even though the office was empty and to get the officers to come downstairs. I relayed this message to the police officers who said, \"You have to make them come, we have a situation here and can\\'t loose the little rapport we have gotten with him \\\\[roommate x\\\\] so far.\" I went back down to the office and made a scene, which after 15 minutes, made the manager finally come up to the apartment.\\n\\nAs soon as he came up and smelled the apartment, he turned to me and said \"We are going to get a crew up here to clean the whole common area and his \\\\[roommate X\\'s\\\\] room.\" A couple more police officers came up to the apartment and struggled to get him to leave his doorway so the cleaning crew could come to clean his room. Given that I had an exam the next day, I went back into my room to study. I came out two hours later and talked to the police officer who said they were going to take him to the hospital for a psychiatric evaluation. The cleaning crew was still cleaning his room. I talked to one of the maintenance people cleaning his room who said \"Y\\'all are men for dealing with this\", about me and roommate normal. I asked him what the smell was and he told me that his bathroom was packed with plastic water bottles full of urine and there were multiple trash bags in the tub that were filled with literal shit.\\n\\nThe police officers told me they didn\\'t have a reason to keep roommate X in the hospital as he looked normal and was able to perform basic tasks like eating and some level of communication, so he may return. Some hospital representative came to discuss pretty much everything that happened that I wrote about above, before they took him to the hospital. The maintenance crew left a ton of air freshener and cloroxed his whole room. His mom came \\\\~2 days later to move all of his stuff out of the apartment and apologized to me and roommate normal. She claimed she didn\\'t know he was this bad and said she thought he was still going to school, even though I never saw him leave the building in the whole year he lived in the apartment.\\n\\nI just learned that the Varsity is trying to sublease his room and am posting this to save some poor soul from having to live in that room. Who knows what else went on in that room.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR: Room 646C in the Varsity had literally bags of shit and pee all over the room and it smelled terrible. The person who lived there didn\\'t shower for a whole year.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT: The worst part is that none of this is fake or exaggerated, and I wish it was. If anything I left stuff out to make it shorter.\\n\\nEDIT 2: Mods asked me to remove the picture of roommate X.',\n",
